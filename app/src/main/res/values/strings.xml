    <string name="exsplain">Albert Einstein, the brilliant physicist from Germany, revolutionized our understanding of the
        universe through his theory of relativity and the iconic equation E = mc².\n\nHis work not only transformed physics but also paved the way for modern technology and
        deeper insights into space, time, and energy.\n\nAs a Nobel laureate and humanist thinker, Einstein is also remembered for his views on peace,
        freedom, and humanity, making him one of the most influential
        figures in the history of science and the world.\n\nThis application was developed for Assessment 1 of the Mobile Programming course.\nCopyright © 2024–2025 Muflih Syarif.All rights reserved.</string>
